# brackets-jdk

This is meant to be an extension to the <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets Editor</a> 
that provides basic Java Development Kit integration. 
<a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/8358">This</a> has been in their list of
extension ideas since Jul 11, 2014. As far as I can tell, no one has implemented it yet, so I decided to 
undertake this project.

The extension is a work in progress and is not yet functional. It has not yet been published. A ToDo list will be added
soon.
